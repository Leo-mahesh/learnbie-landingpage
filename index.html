          <h1>Introduction To html</h1>
          <p>
            At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements,
            which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different
            meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is
            it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections
            (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation
            menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page.
            This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce
            fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.

          <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to
            describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML
            (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes
            how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or
            on other media. CSS is among the core languages of the open web and
            is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications.
            Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was
            done synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest
            recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3.
            However, CSS4 has never become an official version.

          <h1>Introduction To JavaScript</h1>
          <p>
            JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming
            language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by
            Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla
            Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation). JavaScript is versatile
            and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to
            create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive
            database-driven apps, and much more! JavaScript itself is relatively
            compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of
            tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast
            amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:
